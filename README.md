# Japan footprint dataset

The Japan Footprint Dataset comprises approximately 50 million building footprints located within Japan extracted from Mapbox satellite imageryï¼ˆ0.6m resolution) through the utilization of a super-resolution-based instance segmentation method. Extracted models and training details can be found in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271622002933).

## Download dataset
For ease of extraction, the whole of Japan is divided into 4424 10km by 10km grids, and a geojson file exists for each region containing buildings. The number of each folder corresponds to the [Japanese secondary standard mesh](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjq0L7vxPeDAxVAmlYBHRgRBcEQFnoECBIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gsi.go.jp%2Fcommon%2F000218188.pdf&usg=AOvVaw21NZvHJVipnWzBngY28Cl0&opi=89978449).
